# GA Knapsack in C++

This code served as a precursor to better understand the inner workings of genetic algorithms. 

The code built in this repository helped to evaluate the effectiveness of genetic algorithms (GA) and their parallel counterparts (PGA) in solving the knapsack problem; a problem characterized as NP-Complete, meaning that it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time).

The key findings in the research made indicate that for lower complexity problems, a GA is more suitable due to a small number of combinations. However, for high complexity problems, both GA and PGA offer similar solution quality, with PGA being faster when time is crucial. The hardware specifications for the experiments include Intel i5 760 @ 2.8GHz x4 CPU, 4GB DDR3 memory, 50GB HDD storage, and 6.77GB swap space on each of the five homogeneous machines used. Cooling systems were standardized to ensure consistent processing speeds.

# GA Knapsack in C++

This code served as a precursor to better understand the inner workings of genetic algorithms by solving the Knapsack problem with a genetic algorithm in C++; a problem characterized as NP-Complete, meaning that it is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time).
